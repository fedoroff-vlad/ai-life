# gateway-telegram

Telegram entry point. Long-polling bot that:
1. Receives Telegram updates.
2. Resolves identity via `profile-service` (creates household + user on first contact).
3. Builds a `NormalizedMessage` and sends it to `orchestrator`.
4. Replies to the chat with the orchestrator's response.

Media handling (audio / image / video) will land in Stage 1 alongside `mcp-media-processing`.

## Configuration

| env var                          | default                              | required |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------|
| `GATEWAY_PORT`                   | `8080`                               |          |
| `GATEWAY_TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME`  | `ai_life_bot`                        |          |
| `GATEWAY_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`     | *(empty — bot won't start)*          | yes for prod |
| `GATEWAY_DEFAULT_HOUSEHOLD_NAME` | `default household`                  |          |
| `PROFILE_SERVICE_URL`            | `http://profile-service:8082`        |          |
| `ORCHESTRATOR_URL`               | `http://orchestrator:8083`           |          |

If the token is empty the HTTP server still starts (so `/actuator/health` works) but the
bot doesn't connect — handy for CI and local IDE runs.

## How to get a token (Stage 0)

Talk to `@BotFather` on Telegram, run `/newbot`, follow the prompts. Paste the token
into `infra/.env`.

## Run locally

Bring up the dev infra and the dependent services first:

```sh
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
mvn -B -pl platform/llm-gateway -am spring-boot:run        # in one terminal
mvn -B -pl platform/profile-service -am spring-boot:run    # in another
mvn -B -pl platform/orchestrator -am spring-boot:run       # in another
GATEWAY_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=... \
    mvn -B -pl platform/gateway-telegram -am spring-boot:run
```

Then DM your bot. The first message creates your household and you as `admin`.
