# media — shared media-understanding capability

Authority file for the **media-understanding capability-MCP** (`mcp-media-processing`):
the shared toolbox that turns stored media bytes into text/structure (OCR → STT →
vision-caption → video-frames). Owner-prioritised **after D3** (2026-06-19) — see
`roadmap.md` line 21 and STATUS "Deferred work".

## Why a shared capability (the doctrine, not relitigated)
Media (photo / audio / video) can belong to **any** domain — a receipt→finance, a
sick-note→docs/health, an outfit→stylist. So *understanding* it must be a **capability-MCP
any agent binds** (`shared/mcp/mcp-media-processing`, **no schema**) — NOT embedded per
agent. This pays down the interim anti-pattern: `receipt-parser` today runs the `vision`
channel **inside** finance-agent (the canonical "stuffed into one place" shortcut). See
`architecture.md` §"Where each kind of thing lives" (capability-MCP row) and PATTERNS.md
"Recipe: add a capability-MCP". Reuse **free OSS engines** (Tesseract/PaddleOCR/docTR for
OCR, whisper for STT) — do not rebuild, do not add a paid API. Reasoning over the extracted
text stays in the calling agent's skill (the capability returns raw text/structure, not a
domain decision).

## Where it lives / shape
- `shared/mcp/mcp-media-processing` — Spring Boot MCP server, **port 8097**, **no DB**
  (capability-MCP: no JPA / datasource / Liquibase feature). Reads blob bytes from
  **media-service** (`GET /v1/media/{id}` → bytes + content-type, port 8088, PR37) by media
  id — callers pass an id, never raw bytes.
- Tools are schema-less and engine-backed: `ocr` first; `transcribe` (STT) + `caption`
  (vision) later. Tool descriptions in English.
- Bound by agents via `spring.ai.mcp.client.sse.connections.mcp-media-processing` (mirror
  finance-agent ↔ mcp-money-pro-import, PR33) + agent-side env `MCP_MEDIA_PROCESSING_URL`.
  **Multiple agents bind the same server — that is the point.**

## Decision — OCR engine integration: **Tess4J in-image** (LOCKED, owner 2026-06-19)
The `ocr` tool reaches Tesseract via the **Tess4J JNI wrapper** with native `tesseract-ocr`
+ language data bundled in the module's Docker image (fewest moving parts, free, fits
"simple to configure/scale"). Behind the `OcrEngine` interface, so the wiring test stays
native-free. The OCR-sidecar alternative (an OSS OCR HTTP service over `WebClient`) was
considered and deferred — revisit only if a second engine (PaddleOCR/docTR) or scaling
pushes us off-JVM. **Operational notes:** `tessdata` is resolved at startup from
`TESSDATA_PREFIX` → a probe of common distro paths (works across tesseract 4/5 layouts);
CI installs `tesseract-ocr` so the real-OCR test runs (else it self-skips on a bare box).

## PR-sized slices
- **MP-a — scaffold + `ocr` tool on a stub engine (end-to-end, no native dep).** New
  `shared/mcp/mcp-media-processing` module: Spring Boot app + Spring AI MCP server starter,
  `config/HttpConfig` `mediaWebClient` + `http/MediaClient.fetch(mediaId) → (bytes, mime)`
  (mirror finance-agent's `MediaClient`), an `engine/OcrEngine` interface + a deterministic
  `StubOcrEngine` (default bean), `tools/MediaProcessingMcpTools.ocr(mediaId)` →
  fetch bytes → `engine.extract` → new contract `media/OcrResult(text, lang?, confidence?)`.
  Register in root `pom.xml` `<modules>`, compose service block, `.env.example`,
  infra/README port row (8097), README. Test = `MockWebServer` for media-service + stub
  engine (assert id → media fetch → OcrResult). **No native dep, no DB, no agent binding
  yet** — the capability stands alone and is fully testable.
- **MP-b — real OCR engine (Tesseract OSS).** ✅ **DONE.** `TesseractOcrEngine` (Tess4J)
  is the deployed default behind the same `OcrEngine` interface; `StubOcrEngine` is selected
  only by `mediaprocessing.ocr-engine=stub` (the wiring test, degraded boxes). Docker image
  installs `tesseract-ocr` + eng/rus + sets `TESSDATA_PREFIX`; CI installs tesseract so the
  real-OCR test (render → extract → assert) runs. `tessdata` path resolved via env-then-probe.
- **Reorder (owner 2026-06-19):** the `caption` vision tool comes **before** the
  receipt-parser migration — vision-on-the-image is more accurate than parsing noisy OCR
  text, so receipt-parser migrates onto `caption`, not `ocr`. New order: MP-d1 (caption) →
  MP-c (bind + migrate) → MP-d2 (STT).
- **MP-d1 — `caption` vision tool (centralised).** ✅ **DONE.** `caption(mediaId, instruction)`
  fetches bytes from media-service and calls llm-gateway's `vision` channel (via `libs/llm-client`),
  returning the model's text. Centralises the vision call so no agent re-embeds it. Generic:
  the caller supplies the instruction (e.g. "extract amount/currency/merchant/date as JSON")
  and parses the result — reasoning stays in the caller's skill.
- **MP-c — bind to finance-agent + migrate `receipt-parser` off in-agent vision.** Add the
  `mcp-media-processing` SSE connection + `MCP_MEDIA_PROCESSING_URL` to finance-agent;
  `receipt-parser` calls the capability's `caption` (instruction = its current SKILL.md extract
  prompt) instead of running the `vision` channel inline. **Clears the STATUS Deferred
  anti-pattern item.**
- **MP-d2 (later) — `transcribe` (STT, whisper OSS)**, bound by future Stage-6 agents
  (docs, stylist, …). Slice like MP-a/b (stub → real engine).

## Out of scope (here)
- Real LLM providers for `caption` — uses the existing `vision` channel; quality is Stage 5.
- New domain agents that consume the capability (docs / stylist / health) — **Stage 6+**.
- Video-frames extraction (`ffmpeg`) — a later tool once a consumer needs it.
